I always describe data science as "the job I always wanted but it didn't exist yet." I was a weird kid who would sit down with a phone book or the newspaper's sports page and read through it, finding patterns and memorizing the contents. It never really occurred to me that that sort of activity could be a career option. 

My educational journey led me to major in engineering at Rice, followed by an MBA in finance and strategic management at Wharton. Throughout these experiences, I gained valuable skills and knowledge while meeting lots of talented people, but a sense of purpose eluded me.

After working in various roles, including product management for mortgage origination software, I stumbled upon the field of data science around 2015. The moment I discovered it, I recognized it as the perfect fusion of my aptitudes, interests, and aspirations.

With renewed passion, I embraced data projects and even taught a course on data analytics. Eventually, I joined Anda Pharmaceuticals, where I delved into a treasure trove of data, aiding leaders in various departments to make informed decisions.

From 2018 to 2024, I founded and led the data team at TheVentureCity, rising to the position of Chief Data Officer. During my tenure, my team and I assisted startups and investment teams in maximizing the value of available data.

While my non-linear career path may seem unconventional, it has prepared me for the challenges I've encountered in the data science field. Beyond the "Data Dude" nickname, I consider myself a well-rounded executive leader with a diverse background. My ability to communicate technical concepts effectively has helped me establish credibility and trust.

As of May 2024, I have transitioned to an advisory role at TheVentureCity, which allows me the freedom to explore new career opportunities. I am actively brainstorming ideas and consulting with various individuals, confident that I will recognize the right path when it presents itself.

In the meantime, I plan to share my experiences and insights on data science, customer analytics, startup investing, and general business. I also intend to pursue personal data projects in my free time, as my passion for data knows no bounds.
